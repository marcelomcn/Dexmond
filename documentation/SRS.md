# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
# Cross-Chain Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables users to swap tokens across different blockchain networks. The DEX handles real blockchain interactions through established cross-chain bridges.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will provide a comprehensive platform for cross-chain token swaps, liquidity pools management, and asset bridging between multiple blockchain networks. It will support wallet integration, real-time price discovery, and secure transaction handling.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **DEX**: Decentralized Exchange
- **DeFi**: Decentralized Finance
- **RPC**: Remote Procedure Call
- **L2**: Layer 2 solutions (scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 blockchains)

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The cross-chain DEX is a web-based application that interacts with multiple blockchain networks through their respective RPC endpoints. It leverages established cross-chain bridges for token transfers between networks and integrates with various wallet providers for authentication and transaction signing.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Cross-chain token swapping
- Multi-chain wallet integration
- Liquidity pool management
- Real-time price discovery
- Transaction tracking across chains
- Bridge token transfers
- Trading analytics

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Traders**: Users who perform token swaps across chains
- **Liquidity Providers**: Users who provide liquidity to pools
- **Bridge Users**: Users who transfer tokens between chains without swapping
- **Analytics Users**: Users who primarily use the platform for market data

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Frontend**: Web-based interface accessible via modern browsers
- **Backend**: Node.js server for API endpoints and data aggregation
- **Blockchain**: Multiple EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Cross-chain operations are dependent on the reliability of third-party bridge protocols
- Transaction confirmation times vary across different blockchain networks
- Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion
- RPC endpoint reliability affects system performance
